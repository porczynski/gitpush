# gitpush
:trident: linux one command line quick commit, comment and push directly to the Github.com master branch

### Usage:
copy *gitpush* file into your project main directory and run after your work (when you want to send changes to Github)
```shell
./gitpush
```
every time when you want to commit, comment and push directly to the master branch.

For more fun 😊 _gitpush_ places random emoji in the comment.
